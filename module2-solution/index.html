                    <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
                    <p>
                        Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, 
                        one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy 
                        of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed "the 
                        world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially 
                        for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.

                    <p>
                        Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist 
                        who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. He was born 
                        and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, and gained practical 
                        experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry.
